## What is react native? 

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. 
So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props.
If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. 
This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not.

> Facebook released React Native in 2015 and has been maintaining it ever since.

- Building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities.

### React Fundamentals
- components: Function components vs Class components
- JSX: is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code.
- props
- state

- Text
- Image
- ScrollView
- TextInput


### Why Expo?
Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. 
It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop,
build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
